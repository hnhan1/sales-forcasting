# sales-forecasting

Use Walmart historical markdown data to predict store sales https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting. Historical sales data are provided for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains a number of departments and sales data. Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Part of the challenge presented by this competition is modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data.

The goal is to predict the department-wide sales for each store. 

Python is the language of choice and Jupyter is the interactive tool for scientific computing.
