    "**Problem:**  \n",
    "Walmart is a multinational retail corporation that operates globally. Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Walmart would like to forecast sales data by store and department using historical store sales data for 45 Walmart stores.\n"

    "Walmart is the client. Based on forecast sales, Walmart will determine if more employees are needed during high sales days. Also, the analysis will help Walmart determine if additional resources should be allocated to the departments that have low sales."

Only store features, store types, historical sales data (train data set) and test data set (for predictions and final deliverable) are provided. Data is acquired through Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting)."
